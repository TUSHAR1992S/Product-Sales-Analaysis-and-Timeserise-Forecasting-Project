    - Linear Regression Model with Cross Validation and Elastic Net regression
    - Random Forest
- For Time Series model
    - SARIMA
    - SARIMAX
    - Prophet

 ## Deployment
 - Selected sarima and sarimax models and pickled those models
 - After pickling the models we build a python app and deploy it on streamlit.
